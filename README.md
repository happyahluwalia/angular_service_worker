# Angular Shell created to demonstrate creationg of service worker using @angular/service-worker 
 
Currently there are various libararies available for creating service workers 
- sw-precache
- workbox
- @angular/service-worker.

I have created various shell repositories using sw-precache and workbox to try out their functionality.
This repository would work with service-worker library shipped with @angular.
This is currently in beta. 

This is currently deployed [here] (https://happyahluwalia.github.io/angular_service_worker
/). Its a simple PWA with a quick startup time, service worker, manifest and the whole nine yards.

The service worker is generated using the @angular/service-worker
